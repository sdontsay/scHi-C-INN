Auto model annual review:
1. Executive summary
1) Source system balance as of Sep 2024 is $1,542,738,912.00, no available balance for auto, thus the exposure is the same number
2) Probabily remain the same model tiers: tier 2 for PD, tier 3 for LGD and ECL
3) Probability still rated as "Fit for purpose" as the condition has been lifted
4) 13 findings for PD with 6 closed; 10 findings for LGD with 6 closed; 6 findings for ECL with one closed
5) no overlay applied
6) slight model change - smoothing of UER, validated in Finding #1763603

2. Review of model change log
1) No existing model change log
2) the smoothing was validated by MRM
3) it is not clear whether the monitoring is based on the updated model or not

3. Model performance
1) lack of discussion about the monitoring results (such as PD rate, MEVs, and so on)
2) not clear whether the backtesting is 9-quarter cumulative or not; not clear about the weighted basis
3) no statistical validity testing, sensitivity testing, benchmarking analysis, discriminatory power anlaysis, stability analysis, or stationarity testing results provided
4) PSI analysis period is largely overlapped between development and monitoring
5) no overlays and overrides mentioned in either MDD or monitoring resutls

4. Model assumptions and limitations
1) not mentioned

5. Findings
#1: high - monitoring plan
1) PSI benchmark and development periods overlapping
2) monitoring on MEV independent variables
3) LGD and ECl data representation issue
4) annual review questionnaire errors
5) over-prediction issue (need to be mentioned in maintext later)
6) no threshold for coefficent stability test
7) no plan for consumer installment unsecured available
8) detail of testing methods 
9) monitoring of product areas 

#2: medium
1) segment level monitoring
2) benchmark
3) scenario forecast of model
4) discriminatory power
5) data assessment

#3: low
1ï¼‰ ALWs (not test)
2) model change log lacking
3) monitoring frequency
4) installment unsecured
5) HPI

6. Enhanced model annual review for 2024 validation cycle
1) this is a new model, everything is aligned with the new MRM standards
2) the assessment of any changes in product areas, business and strategy, and so on needs to be filled

7. Appendix
1) model information could be acquired in Archer or updated by MRM
2) annual review questionnaire has been initiated
